Proposed Classes
================

//
// Container for information about a specific file
//
FileInfo
  m_Id; // unique identifier for this file
  m_Path; // path relative to the top-level directory that contains this file
  m_Revision; // revision number of this file
  m_Hash; // md5 hash of the file contents of this revision

//
// Base class for all storage systems
//

StorageSystem
    // gets the file list for the given directory
    // if a time is specified, get the file list at that point in time
    void GetFileList( const Path& directory, <vector FileInfo>&, time (optional) )

    // commit an update of a file to the storage system
    bool UpdateFile( const FileInfo& )

    // get a file from the storage system
    bool GetFile( const FileInfo& )

//
// A storage system backed by a local location
//
LocalStorage isa StorageSystem

//
// A storage system backed by a server
//
ServerStorage isa StorageSystem

//
// A storage system backed by Amazon's S3
//
//   Maybe it's possible to use Amazon's DB services instead of having a server in this case?
//   If not, then S3Storage would probably be a part of the server rather than the client
//
S3Storage isa StorageSystem


Startup
=========

- Start up
- Parse configuration file
  - Contains a list of directories
    - account, GUID, name, local location
- Iterate through server directories
  - Check with server/backing store that they are valid
  - Obtain file list/md5s
  - Ensure they exist in proper local location
  - Iterate through local files in each directory
      - If missing:
        - Get file from server
      - If md5 mismatch
        - File is newer: update server with new file
        - File is older: update local file from server
- Loop, waiting for changes
  - Server change message
    - Delete/create local file
  - Local file change
    - Notify server, send new file        

Use case: rollback and pin
==========================

- User right-clicks in a synced directory
- User selects a rollback
- User enters a time (default 1 hour)
- Set directory to pinned state
  - Set pinned time
- Query server for file list at that time
  - Iterate over local files
    - If not in server list
      - Has been uploaded?
        - Yes: do nothing
        - No: upload to server
      - Remove from local
    - If in server list and newer than server
      - Roll back to server state
  - Iterate over server files
    - If not in local store
      - Download from server to reflect -1 hour state
- Loop, waiting for changes
  - Server change message
    - Take no action on physical disk due to pinned state
  - Local file change
    - Notify server, send new file

Update Loop
===========

- Pump
  - Server change message/Peer change message
    - Update file
      - If pinned
        - Disregard
      
      - If file exists locally
        - If message is 'delete file'
          - Verify md5 matches last known server md5
            - Matches:
              - Delete file
            - Mismatch:
              - Upload file to server
              - Delete file
          - Return
              
        - Compare md5
          - Match: update local db
          - Mismatch: check file time
            - Local newer
              - Upload to server as new rev
            - Local older
              - Upload to server as older rev
              - Replace local copy with newer file

      - If file does not exist locally
        - If message is 'delete file'
          - Return
        - Create file
        - Update local db
             
  - Local file change
    - Notify server, send new file
    - Notify all peers who share directory, send new file
  
  - Peer connection
    - Add to list of connected peers
    
  - Sleep

UI
====
  - Tray icon
    - Listens for core events, reflects state in UI
    - Provides user control:
      - Pause/Run
      - Enter a status
      - Statistics
      - Preferences
      - If only a single directory configured, double-click opens it
      - If multiple directories, double-click opens a menu with a list
  - Explorer integration
    - Right-click menu allows:
      - Pause a single directory
      - Roll a directory back and 'pin' it
    - Folder overlays indicate:
      - Syncing
      - Synced
      - Pinned
      - Error
